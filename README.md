**Hiraku Kurafuto** is a next-generation voxel sandbox game that puts developers, modders, and players first. Built from the ground up for infinite scale and absolute freedom, this engine is a blank canvas. We provide the performance and the API; you build the worlds.

### ⚡ The Engine

* **Infinite Voxel Worlds:** High-performance, endlessly generating, and fully destructible terrain.
* **Deep Engine Access:** A robust, unrestricted API designed to let plugins and mods alter core mechanics without friction.
* **Radical Transparency:** 100% open-source, forever. Development is driven by community consensus and active player feedback.

### 🔓 Creator Freedom

We believe your code is your property. Because Hiraku Kurafuto operates under the permissive **MIT License**, you have absolute authority over your creations. We provide the sandbox, but you own your work.

| Freedom | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Copyleft** | Keep your mods open-source, or lock them down as closed-source. It is your call. |
| **Zero Royalties** | Sell your mods, charge for server access, or distribute for free. We take nothing. |
| **Complete Control** | Build simple quality-of-life tweaks or massive, premium commercial expansions. |
