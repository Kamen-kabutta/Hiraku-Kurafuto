# Hiraku-Kurafuto
Hiraku Kurafuto is an open-source voxel sandbox game inspired by the classics but built for the future. Our core philosophy is simple: listen to the players, build a rock-solid modding foundation, and give creators absolute freedom to monetize their mods and plugins however they choose.
